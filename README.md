# Feast-Findr


## Description

We've never heard of anybody who doesn't like a good food truck. Whether they are just down the road during your lunchbreak, in the parking lot of the club you just left, or vendors at the hottest music festival, food trucks are a fun and convenient way to try cool new culinary experiences on the go.

The downside of that convenience and mobility is that they can be VERY unpredictable.
They can role into town, serve you a Doner Kebab that can change your life, and drive off the same day!
Feast-Findr connects hungry customers with all the great food trucks in your area! 
Normally finding these trucks is left to chance, with Feast-Finder you know what's nearby whenever the mood strikes!

Making this app taught us how complex the most simple app features can be to design, as well as how rewarding it is to make something that we
would definitely use ourselves!

## Features

This app serves two clients : 1. Adventurous diners 2. The food trucks that serve them.

For the diners, they can hop on Feast-Findr, put in their address, and receive a list of food trucks within a 25 mile radius.
They can then select and view info on the food trucks.


For the food truck owners, they can create a profile and add their food truck. The truck's name, type of cuisine, logo, menu 
and location are all displayed to the user when selected.
